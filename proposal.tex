	\subsection{Handling of research data}
%	\subsection{Umgang mit Forschungsdaten}
	Data generated during this project will be used for scientific publications in
	preprint and peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, all necessary data (such as raw
	sequencing data) will be deposited in publicly available repositories
	(\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/}{NCBI GEO} and
	\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra}{SRA}, \href{https://osf.io/}{OSF}). To
	allow complete reproducibility of all analyses, the source code and executed
	comands will be also made publicly available
	(\href{https://github.com/}{GitHub}).  Thus, all relevant data will become
	accessible for future use.
